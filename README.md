# Humanizer (voiceprint fork)

A skill for Claude Code and OpenCode that removes signs of AI-generated writing from text, making it sound more natural and human.

## Fork and attribution

This is a fork of [blader/humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer) (MIT, copyright 2025 Siqi Chen). The original skill and all 30 detection patterns are that project's work; full credit goes there.

This fork adds a persistent preference profile and a one-time voice fingerprint so a writing sample is analyzed once and reused across runs. That mechanism is adapted from the `agentic-humanizer` skill in [numen-tech/slopornot](https://github.com/numen-tech/slopornot) (MIT, copyright 2025 Siqi Chen, copyright 2026 Thilak Rao). It is reworked to run as a single disciplined pass on Windows/PowerShell with no Slop or Not Pro scoring loop and no macOS dependency. See `NOTICE` for the attribution summary.

## What this fork adds

- **Saved profile** at `$HOME/.humanizer/profile.json`: dialect, target reading grade, tone, and length policy. Set once, reused silently. Subcommands: `show profile`, `reset profile`, `set dialect=us grade=10 tone=professional length=±10`.
- **Multi-target voice library** under `$HOME/.humanizer/voices/<name>/` (a `sample.txt` plus a `fingerprint.json` cached by content hash, one folder per named voice). You can save more than one voice (e.g. `teon`, `formal`, a client persona). A voice applies to a rewrite **only when you name it** (`voice=<name>`); with no voice named the rewrite is a generic de-AI pass in no persona. Subcommands: `list voices`, `add voice <name>`, `set voice <name>=<path>`, `show voice <name>`, `reset voice <name>`, `default voice <name>` / `default voice off`. Inline overrides: `voice=<name>`, `voice=<path>`, `voice=off`, `voice-skip`. The profile keeps only rewrite prefs plus an optional `default_voice` (null by default, so nothing is auto-applied).
- Still a single rewrite pass. The profile and fingerprint apply as constraints on that pass, not as extra loops. The em-dash ban and the "never alter verbatim quotes, legal text, section numbers, or data" rule override everything else, including a voice's recorded punctuation habits (em-dashes are matched in rhythm but never reproduced).

Details live in `references/voice-fingerprint.md`.

## Installation

### Claude Code

Clone directly into Claude Code's skills directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/blader/humanizer.git ~/.claude/skills/humanizer
```

Or copy the skill file manually if you already have this repo cloned:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/humanizer
cp SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/humanizer/
```

### OpenCode

Clone directly into OpenCode's skills directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills
git clone https://github.com/blader/humanizer.git ~/.config/opencode/skills/humanizer
```

Or copy the skill file manually if you already have this repo cloned:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills/humanizer
cp SKILL.md ~/.config/opencode/skills/humanizer/
```

> **Note:** OpenCode also scans `~/.claude/skills/` for compatibility, so if you use both tools, a single clone into `~/.claude/skills/humanizer/` is enough.

## Usage

### Claude Code

```
/humanizer

[paste your text here]
```

### OpenCode

```
/humanizer

[paste your text here]
```

Or ask the model to humanize text directly in either tool:

```
Please humanize this text: [your text]
```

### Voice Calibration

To match your personal writing style, provide a sample of your own writing:

```
/humanizer

Here's a sample of my writing for voice matching:
[paste 2-3 paragraphs of your own writing]

Now humanize this text:
[paste AI text to humanize]
```

The skill will analyze your sentence rhythm, word choices, and quirks, then apply them to the rewrite instead of producing generic "clean" output.

## Overview

Based on [Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing) guide, maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup. This comprehensive guide comes from observations of thousands of instances of AI-generated text.

The skill also includes a final "obviously AI generated" audit pass and a second rewrite, to catch lingering AI-isms in the first draft.

**After (Humanized):**
> AI coding assistants can speed up the boring parts of the job. They're great at boilerplate: config files and the little glue code you don't want to write. They can also help you sketch a test, but you still have to read it.
>
> The dangerous part is how confident the suggestions look. I've accepted code that compiled and passed lint, then discovered later it missed the point because I stopped paying attention.
>
> If you treat it like autocomplete and review every line, it's useful. If you use it to avoid thinking, it will help you ship bugs faster.
>
> The only real backstop is tests. Without them, you're mostly judging vibes.

## Version History

- **2.9.0** - Multi-target voices: replaced the single global `voice.txt`/`voice-fingerprint.json` with a per-voice library under `$HOME/.humanizer/voices/<name>/`. A voice applies only when named (`voice=<name>`); no forced global voice. New subcommands (`list voices`, `add voice`, `set voice <name>=`, `show voice <name>`, `reset voice <name>`, `default voice`). Fingerprint schema adds `voice_name`; the hash now targets the resolved sample. Em-dash ban explicitly overrides any voice's recorded dash habit. One-time migration of a legacy global voice into `voices/<name>/`. No change to the 30 patterns.
- **2.8.0** - Fork: added a saved preference profile (dialect, grade, tone, length) and a persistent voice fingerprint extracted once from a writing sample and reused across runs. Voice mechanism adapted from numen-tech/slopornot, reworked to Windows/PowerShell and a single pass. No change to the 30 patterns.
- **2.7.0** - Added pattern #30 (diff-anchored writing); made em/en dashes a hard cut rather than "overuse"; expanded #21 to cover speculative gap-filling ("maintains a low profile"). 30 patterns total.
- **2.6.0** - Cleanup pass: consolidated the duplicated workflow sections, gated the personality guidance to content where voice is wanted, removed the model-fingerprinting subsection, and condensed the worked example. No change to the 29 patterns.
- **2.5.1** - Added a passive-voice / subjectless-fragment rule, raising the total to 29 patterns
- **2.5.0** - Added patterns for persuasive framing, signposting, and fragmented headers; expanded negative parallelisms to cover tailing negations; tightened wording around em dash overuse; fixed frontmatter wording to use "filler phrases"
- **2.4.0** - Added voice calibration: match the user's personal writing style from samples
- **2.3.0** - Added pattern #25: hyphenated word pair overuse
- **2.2.0** - Added a final "obviously AI generated" audit + second-pass rewrite prompts
- **2.1.1** - Fixed pattern #18 example (curly quotes vs straight quotes)
- **2.1.0** - Added before/after examples for all 24 patterns
- **2.0.0** - Complete rewrite based on raw Wikipedia article content
- **1.0.0** - Initial release
